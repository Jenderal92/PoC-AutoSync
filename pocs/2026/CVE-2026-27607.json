  "description": "Missing post-policy validation in RustFS",
  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "RustFS is a distributed object storage system built in Rust. In versions 1.0.0-alpha.56 through 1.0.0-alpha.82, RustFS does not validate policy conditions in presigned POST uploads (PostObject), allowing attackers to bypass content-length-range, starts-with, and Content-Type constraints. This enables unauthorized file uploads exceeding size limits, uploads to arbitrary object keys, and content-type spoofing, potentially leading to storage exhaustion, unauthorized data access, and security bypasses. Version 1.0.0-alpha.83 fixes the issue.",
