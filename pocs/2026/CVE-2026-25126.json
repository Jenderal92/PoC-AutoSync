  "description": "CVE-2026-25126 Proof-of-Concept demonstrating vote count manipulation in PolarLearn due to improper runtime validation of the forum vote direction parameter. Published after upstream patch release.",
  "stargazers_count": "1",
  "vuln_description": "PolarLearn is a free and open-source learning program. Prior to version 0-PRERELEASE-15, the vote API route (`POST /api/v1/forum/vote`) trusts the JSON body’s `direction` value without runtime validation. TypeScript types are not enforced at runtime, so an attacker can send arbitrary strings (e.g., `\"x\"`) as `direction`. Downstream (`VoteServer`) treats any non-`\"up\"` and non-`null` value as a downvote and persists the invalid value in `votes_data`. This can be exploited to bypass intended business logic. Version 0-PRERELEASE-15 fixes the vulnerability.",
