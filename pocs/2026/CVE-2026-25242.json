  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "Gogs is an open source self-hosted Git service. Versions 0.13.4 and below expose unauthenticated file upload endpoints by default. When the global RequireSigninView setting is disabled (default), any remote user can upload arbitrary files to the server via /releases/attachments and /issues/attachments. This enables the instance to be abused as a public file host, potentially leading to disk exhaustion, content hosting, or delivery of malware. CSRF tokens do not mitigate this attack due to same-origin cookie issuance. This issue has been fixed in version 0.14.1.",
