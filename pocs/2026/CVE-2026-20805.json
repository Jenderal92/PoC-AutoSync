  "description": "Microsoft just patched CVE-2026-20805 and CVE-2026-20871 in January 2026 to stop \"Information Disclosure\" and \"Use-After-Free\" bugs in DWM. They think they've secured the \"Visual Boundary.\" We are about to prove that a 33-layer resonance can turn those visual buffers into a liquid pipeline for SCTT-2026-33-0002.",
