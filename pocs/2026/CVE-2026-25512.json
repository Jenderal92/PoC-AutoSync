  "vuln_description": "Group-Office is an enterprise customer relationship management and groupware tool. Prior to versions 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5, there is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Group-Office. The endpoint email/message/tnefAttachmentFromTempFile directly concatenates the user-controlled parameter tmp_file into an exec() call. By injecting shell metacharacters into tmp_file, an authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server. This issue has been patched in versions 6.8.150, 25.0.82, and 26.0.5.",
