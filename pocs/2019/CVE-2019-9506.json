  "description": "Key Negotiation Of Bluetooth (KNOB) attacks on Bluetooth BR/EDR and BLE [CVE-2019-9506]",
  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This allows practical brute-force attacks (aka \"KNOB\") that can decrypt traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing.",
