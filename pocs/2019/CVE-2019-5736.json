  "description": "This repository provides a high-fidelity technical deconstruction and production-ready exploitation suite for CVE-2019-5736. It demonstrates how a root user inside a container can achieve a Host Root Shell by overwriting the host runc binary using an OverlayFS mount and ld.so.preload manipulation.",
  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.",
