  "description": "This Python PoC script detects the Heartbleed vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) by performing a TLS handshake with heartbeat extension and sending a crafted heartbeat request. It parses responses to identify leaked memory, helping assess server susceptibility to this critical OpenSSL flaw.",
  "stargazers_count": "2",
  "vuln_description": "The (1) TLS and (2) DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading private keys, related to d1_both.c and t1_lib.c, aka the Heartbleed bug.",
