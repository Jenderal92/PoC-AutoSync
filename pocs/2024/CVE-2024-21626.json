  "description": "PoC for CVE-2024-21626: runc leaks an internal fd referencing the host CWD before pivot_root, enabling container escape by setting process.cwd to /proc/self/fd/7",
  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this issue.
