  "description": "Unauthenticated authentication bypass to RCE exploit for CVE-2024-10924. Abuses an authentication and 2FA bypass in the Really Simple Security WordPress plugin to impersonate an admin user, upload a malicious plugin, and achieve remote command execution via an interactive shell.",
  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "The Really Simple Security (Free, Pro, and Pro Multisite) plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions 9.0.0 to 9.1.1.1. This is due to improper user check error handling in the two-factor REST API actions with the 'check_login_and_get_user' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, when the \"Two-Factor Authentication\" setting is enabled (disabled by default).",
