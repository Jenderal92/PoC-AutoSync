  "vuln_description": "A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved validation. This issue is fixed in iOS 17.4 and iPadOS 17.4. An attacker with arbitrary kernel read and write capability may be able to bypass kernel memory protections. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited.",
