  "description": "Advanced PoC & Research for CVE-2026-0828 (Safetica) and CVE-2025-7771 (ThrottleStop). Analysis of BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) TTPs for Ring 0 process termination and physical memory R/W. Researching EDR-Killer patterns, PPL bypasses, and kernel-mode primitives used by MedusaLocker and other threat actors.",
  "stargazers_count": "1",
  "vuln_description": "ThrottleStop.sys, a legitimate driver, exposes two IOCTL interfaces that allow arbitrary read and write access to physical memory via the MmMapIoSpace function. This insecure implementation can be exploited by a malicious user-mode application to patch the running Windows kernel and invoke arbitrary kernel functions with ring-0 privileges. The vulnerability enables local attackers to execute arbitrary code in kernel context, resulting in privilege escalation and potential follow-on attacks, such as disabling security software or bypassing kernel-level protections. ThrottleStop.sys version 3.0.0.0 and possibly others are affected. Apply updates per vendor instructions.",
