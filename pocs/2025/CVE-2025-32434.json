  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "PyTorch is a Python package that provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. In version 2.5.1 and prior, a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in PyTorch when loading a model using torch.load with weights_only=True. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.0.",
