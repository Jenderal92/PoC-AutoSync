  "vuln_description": "A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability was found in libblockdev. Generally, the \"allow_active\" setting in Polkit permits a physically present user to take certain actions based on the session type. Due to the way libblockdev interacts with the udisks daemon, an \"allow_active\" user on a system may be able escalate to full root privileges on the target host. Normally, udisks mounts user-provided filesystem images with security flags like nosuid and nodev to prevent privilege escalation.  However, a local attacker can create a specially crafted XFS image containing a SUID-root shell, then trick udisks into resizing it. This mounts their malicious filesystem with root privileges, allowing them to execute their SUID-root shell and gain complete control of the system.",
