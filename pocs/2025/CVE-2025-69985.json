  "stargazers_count": "1",
  "vuln_description": "FUXA 1.2.8 and prior contains an Authentication Bypass vulnerability leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The vulnerability exists in the server/api/jwt-helper.js middleware, which improperly trusts the HTTP \"Referer\" header to validate internal requests. A remote unauthenticated attacker can bypass JWT authentication by spoofing the Referer header to match the server's host. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to access the protected /api/runscript endpoint and execute arbitrary Node.js code on the server.",
