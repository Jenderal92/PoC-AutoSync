  "description": "A Proof of Concept for chaining CVE-2025-6018 (PAM/Polkit Active Session Bypass) and CVE-2025-6019 (libblockdev SUID Mount Flaw) to achieve Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) on vulnerable Linux systems.",
  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "A Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been discovered in pam-config within Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM). This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker (for example, a user logged in via SSH) to obtain the elevated privileges normally reserved for a physically present, \"allow_active\" user. The highest risk is that the attacker can then perform all allow_active yes Polkit actions, which are typically restricted to console users, potentially gaining unauthorized control over system configurations, services, or other sensitive operations.",
