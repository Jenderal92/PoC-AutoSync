  "description": "Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.35 â€“ 2.4.63 are vulnerable to a client certificate authentication bypass when TLS 1.3 session resumption is used across virtual hosts with different `SSLCACertificateFile` directives.",
  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to 2.4.63, an access control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS 1.3 session resumption.\n\nConfigurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.",
