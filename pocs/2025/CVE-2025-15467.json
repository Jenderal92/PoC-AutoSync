  "vuln_description": "Issue summary: Parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData message with maliciously\ncrafted AEAD parameters can trigger a stack buffer overflow.\n\nImpact summary: A stack buffer overflow may lead to a crash, causing Denial\nof Service, or potentially remote code execution.\n\nWhen parsing CMS AuthEnvelopedData structures that use AEAD ciphers such as\nAES-GCM, the IV (Initialization Vector) encoded in the ASN.1 parameters is\ncopied into a fixed-size stack buffer without verifying that its length fits\nthe destination. An attacker can supply a crafted CMS message with an\noversized IV, causing a stack-based out-of-bounds write before any\nauthentication or tag verification occurs.\n\nApplications and services that parse untrusted CMS or PKCS#7 content using\nAEAD ciphers (e.g., S/MIME AuthEnvelopedData with AES-GCM) are vulnerable.\nBecause the overflow occurs prior to authentication, no valid key material\nis required to trigger it. While exploitability to remote code execution\ndepends on platform and toolchain mitigations, the stack-b",
