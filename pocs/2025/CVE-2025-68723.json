Three instances exist: (1) the log file name parameter in the Local Services Log page, (2) certificate file content in the SSL Certificates View Usage feature, and (3) the Certificate File name parameter in the WebMail Listeners SSL settings. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript payloads that execute in administrators' browsers when they access affected pages or features, enabling privilege escalation attacks where low-privileged admins can force high-privileged admins to perform unauthorized actions.",
