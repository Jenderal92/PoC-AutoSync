  "vuln_description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nposix-cpu-timers: fix race between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()\n\nIf an exiting non-autoreaping task has already passed exit_notify() and\ncalls handle_posix_cpu_timers() from IRQ, it can be reaped by its parent\nor debugger right after unlock_task_sighand().\n\nIf a concurrent posix_cpu_timer_del() runs at that moment, it won't be\nable to detect timer->it.cpu.firing != 0: cpu_timer_task_rcu() and/or\nlock_task_sighand() will fail.\n\nAdd the tsk->exit_state check into run_posix_cpu_timers() to fix this.\n\nThis fix is not needed if CONFIG_POSIX_CPU_TIMERS_TASK_WORK=y, because\nexit_task_work() is called before exit_notify(). But the check still\nmakes sense, task_work_add(&tsk->posix_cputimers_work.work) will fail\nanyway in this case.",
