  "stargazers_count": "0",
  "vuln_description": "** DISPUTED ** Laminas Project laminas-http before 2.14.2, and Zend Framework 3.0.0, has a deserialization vulnerability that can lead to remote code execution if the content is controllable, related to the __destruct method of the Zend\\Http\\Response\\Stream class in Stream.php. NOTE: Zend Framework is no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE: the laminas-http vendor considers this a \"vulnerability in the PHP language itself\" but has added certain type checking as a way to prevent exploitation in (unrecommended) use cases where attacker-supplied data can be deserialized.",
